                    <h2> About Me</h2>
                    <p> My name is Styrling Morris, pictured  is me and my woderful wife. We currently are living
                        in Pocatello, Idaho. We have two dogs that I always want to beat you cuddle, and we both love being 
                        around friends, family, and eachother. I have a bachelor's degree in exercise science, I started my college 
                        journey wanting to be a dentist but after 100 hours of shadowing I found out that I didn't want to stare into
                        people's mouths all day. I finished my degree and moved to Pocattello where I currently help my father 
                        manage a construction company. I do a lot of the behind the scenes work but every now and then i get my hands
                        dirty. I have decided to do the bootcamp to develop coding skills so that I can pursue a career that is more family
                        oriented and is easier on the body. I don't know much about coding but the very little that i have learned so far I 
                        am excited to see what is in store for our future.
